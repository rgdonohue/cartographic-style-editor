## User Data Setup

Since tile data is excluded from the repository:

### For End Users
1. **Demo Mode**: Application works immediately without data
2. **Full Functionality**: Users follow TILES.md to get Colorado data
3. **Custom Data**: Users can substitute their own PMTiles

### For Collaborators
1. **Share data separately**: Send PMTiles files outside of git
2. **Document data sources**: Reference Tilecraft and OSM
3. **Provide fallback**: Ensure demo mode works for development
