# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title: **Map Remix ‚Äì A Live Cartographic Style Editor**

---

## üìò Summary

Map Remix is a browser-based, interactive cartographic design tool that enables users to customize the visual style of Colorado highway, river, and rail data in real time. It leverages pre-rendered vector tiles (PMTiles) and MapLibre GL JS to let users toggle layers, adjust symbology, apply predefined themes, and export their custom map styles as JSON files.

This tool is intended as both a creative sandbox and a frontend experiment in agentic, modular development. It also serves as a testbed for PRD/SDD-driven workflows with AI co-development.

---

## üéØ Goals

* Empower users to interactively edit map styles with immediate feedback.
* Enable the export and reuse of custom styles via JSON.
* Explore LLM-assisted cartographic styling in a tightly scoped, frontend-only tool.
* Showcase beautiful, expressive maps from vector tile data without backend complexity.

## üß≠ User Journey

1. **Initial Load:** User loads the app in a browser (desktop-first, mobile-tolerant)
2. **Map Initialization:** MapLibre initializes with a default style and PMTiles source
3. **Layer Control:** User toggles layers (highways, rivers, rails) and sees immediate visual feedback
4. **Style Customization:** User adjusts style parameters via UI (color, width, opacity) with live preview
5. **Theme Exploration:** Optionally, user loads a style theme or triggers "Shuffle" for inspiration
6. **Export & Share:** User exports their current style as `style.json` and/or PNG snapshot

**Expected Time to First Export:** < 2 minutes for new users

---

## üîë Features

### Core (MVP)

* **Map Rendering:** Vector tiles via MapLibre GL JS from hosted PMTiles
* **Layer Controls:** Toggle visibility of highways, rivers, rails, and optional OSM points
* **Symbology Editor:** Color pickers, stroke width sliders (1-10px), opacity controls (0-100%)
* **Style Themes:** 3‚Äì5 curated presets (Retro, Night, Terrain, Minimal, High Contrast)
* **Export Functions:** 
  - Download current style as `style.json`
  - Export static PNG snapshot of current map view (1024x768px)
* **Reset Function:** One-click return to default style

### Next Phase (Stretch Goals)

* **Style Randomizer:** "Surprise Me" button with aesthetic constraints
* **Import/Export:** Load external `style.json` files with validation
* **URL Sharing:** Save/share map configurations as query strings
* **Enhanced Mobile:** Responsive layout optimization and PWA support
* **Performance:** Service worker for full offline functionality
* **AI Integration:** Style generation from natural language prompts

## üì¶ Technical Specifications

### Frontend Stack
* **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES2020+), MapLibre GL JS v3.x
* **Styling:** PicoCSS (lightweight alternative to Bulma for faster loads)
* **Build:** No bundler required - direct ES module imports

### Data & Performance
* **Tile Format:** PMTiles (vector) served over HTTPS with CORS headers
* **Target Bundle Size:** < 15MB total (tiles + assets) for offline capability
* **Tile Optimization:** Tippecanoe-generated at zoom levels 6‚Äì12, max 500KB per tile
* **Browser Support:** Modern Chromium, Firefox, Safari (WebGL2 required)

### Code Architecture
* **Agent-Friendly Design:** 
  - Modular ES modules with single responsibilities
  - Clear folder structure: `/src/components/`, `/src/utils/`, `/src/styles/`
  - Documented APIs with JSDoc comments
  - Functional programming patterns where possible

### Licensing & Data
* **Base Data:** OSM under ODbL, Colorado state data confirmed public domain
* **Code License:** MIT (for maximum reusability)
* **Distribution:** Static hosting compatible (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## üßò Dharma Drop

> "Color is the breath of form; design is the echo of intention. When style becomes a practice of awareness, the map reflects more than terrain ‚Äî it reflects care."
